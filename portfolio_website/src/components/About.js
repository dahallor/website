            <p>Hello! My name is David Halloran. In 2015 I graduated from Millersville University with my bacholer's in Financial Economics.
                And from there I fell into accounting and worked as an accountant for 5 years. It was.....ok, let's say.
                And for a while I was content with that, I figured there wasn't really going to be any opportunity for a career change.
            </p>
            <p>But then in 2020, the *craziest thing* happened. So during quarentine I decided now was the best time for a change and started my Master's program at Drexel University.
                Now with the degree completed I'm looking to go out into the world.
            </p>
